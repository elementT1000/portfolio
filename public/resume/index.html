Surpassed previous sales performance metrics within 4 weeks by conducting continuous experimentation of messaging structure (emails, voice mails, and calls) to rapidly iterate outreach on a week-by-week basis. Provided 2 dashboard overviews of outbound sales performance by aggregating 6 months of historical metrics for open/answer rates, responses, meetings set, closed-won/lost deals, and revenue in Excel, Outreach, and Tableau. Delivered key insights to a 7 person sales team at least 2 times per week to increase the volume of communication and to enable weekly iterations to sales pipeline development. Sr. Data Project Engineer Project Farma | San Diego, CA | 2023 (Project Contract)\nProject: Implemented a database migration to improve management of equipment and maintenance in a biotech manufacturing facility.\nSaved over $60k in anticipated labor costs and completed a database migration project in less than 6 months (under 50% of the project timeline) by planning and implementing an efficient migration strategy. Transferred historical data for more than 62,000 records to a relational database and management system by building a robust data pipeline to collect, clean, verify, and transfer data from a paper-based system. Achieved full compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 Part 11 through the careful implementation of data management strategies and curation of 4 Standard Operating Procedures and Verification/Validation documentation for the database software. Reduced errors and automated large portions of the process while ensuring traceability by developing SQL scripts, Python scripts, Excel workbooks, and training a 4-person team on their use. Ensured regulatory compliance by performing a gap analysis based on 17 collected current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) documents. Cofounder \u0026 Chief Technology Officer T4 Movement | Austin, TX | 2022 - 2023\nProject: Developed an automated gait analysis solution to aid in physical therapy and workflow management.\nReduced the time for quantitative patient movement data collection by 98.8%, from 3 days to less than 10 minutes, and increased the volume of raw data collected by approximately 10x by developing an innovative product. Communicated with a customer base of more than 100 Physical Therapists (PT) to identify critical needs and built a set of 3 custom Pose Estimation Computer Vision models, 6 ML models, an interactive dashboard built in Python, and a web application to address these needs. Enabled actionable insights for Physical Therapists by designing and implementing a HIPAA-compliant data pipeline that processed 8GB of patient data per use and automatically stored this data in a hierarchical database using PowerShell Scripts. Created 7 Standard Operating Procedures to help train engineers and developers to utilize our proprietary software infrastructure, and to present technical content to non-technical team members and customers. Education Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, May 2022\nGraduated with High Honors, the highest GPA within Nanotechnology and Biomedical Imaging, by achieving a 3.95 GPA Relevant Course Work: R for Biostatistics - 2019 - Grade: 98/100 Engineering Economic Analysis - 2020 - Grade: 90/100 Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, July 2024 Soft Skills Collaboration:\nTeamwork \u0026 Leadership: Organized and led a foreign travel program in high school, coordinating with teachers, administrators, and parents to successfully plan and execute educational trips for 20+ students from a small Texas town to two European countries on two separate occasions.
