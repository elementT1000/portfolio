Experience in business analysis with the full data stack: Excel, Python, Tableau, and PowerBI. As well as hands-on AI model development in a production environment (Computer Vision), Machine Learning models, and prompt engineering to solve business challenges.\nEducation Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering, University of Texas at San Antonio, May 2022\nGraduated with High Honors (The highest GPA within discipline) 3.95 GPA Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate, July 2024 Professional Experience Business Intelligence Analyst Greenlight Guru | Remote | 2024\nProject: Built out a pipeline and outbound strategies for business development of clinical study tools.\nDeveloped data driven outbound email sequences and call strategies that drove a 9.3% email reply rate (\u003e2x performance improvement), 8.2% phone answer rate, and 117% quota attainment. Aggregated outreach data and successful customer profiles in Excel, Outreach, and Tableau for weekly reporting. Collaborated with the sales team (stakeholders) to integrate key insights from statistics and data aggregation with their domain knowledge. Conducted continuous experimentation of messaging structure (emails, voice mails, and calls) to rapidly iterate outreach on a week-by-week basis. Sr. Data Project Engineer Project Farma | San Diego, CA | 2023 (Project Contract)\nProject: Implemented a Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS).\nPlanned and implemented a database migration strategy from start to finish within 6 months, \u003c50% of the project timeline. Saved more than $60k in anticipated labor costs due to this speed. Built a data management pipeline to collect, clean, verify, and transfer data from a paper-based management system to a computerized database and management system. Ensured compliance with 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 21 Part 11 through the careful implementation of data management strategies and curation of Standard Operating Procedures. Developed several python scripts, Excel workbooks, and trained a team on their use in order to reduce errors and automate large portions of the process while ensuring traceability. Collected and organized current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) documentation in order to perform a gap analysis and ensure regulatory compliance. Cofounder \u0026 Chief Technology Officer T4 Movement | Austin, TX | 2022 - 2023\nProject: Developed an automated gait analysis solution to aid in physical therapy and workflow management.\nDeveloped a product that reduced the time to quantitative data collection from 3 days to less than 10 minutes, a 98.8% reduction. The volume of raw data collected increased by roughly 10x. Communicated with a customer base of Physical Therapists (PT) to identify critical needs and built a set of custom Computer Vision, ML models, and Python scripts to address these needs. Created interactive dashboard tools with the Dash Python package and Tableau to allow PT’s to interact with patient data to derive key medical insights. Designed and managed the implementation of a HIPAA compliant data pipeline that converted patient data into actionable insights for Physical Therapists. Created extensive documentation and Standard Operating Procedures to help train engineers and developers to utilize our proprietary software infrastructure, and to present technical content to non-technical team members and customers. Key Differentiators from Other Analysts Communication - Experience in tech sales, entrepreneurship, and freelance work. This has honed the ability to speak to non-technical audiences with a relatable and charismatic style.\nTechnical - Experience in software development in a professional environment. Resulting in knowledge of version control, documentation, and a suite of tools not typically used by an analyst.\n","wordCount":"576","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-11-30T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2024-11-30T00:00:00Z","author":[{"@type":"Person","name":"Ethan Trotter"}],"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"http://localhost:1313/portfolio/resume/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Ethan Trotter","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"http://localhost:1313/portfolio/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/images/FulcrumIcon.png alt aria-label=logo height=55>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/projects/ title=Projects><span>Projects</span></a></li><li><a href=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/resume/ title=Resume><span class=active>Resume</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=http://localhost:1313/portfolio/>Home</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Resume</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-11-30 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>November 30, 2024</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;3 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;576 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Ethan Trotter</div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=business-intelligence-analyst>Business Intelligence Analyst<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#business-intelligence-analyst>#</a></h2><p>Adept data analyst and engineer with a successful track record across advanced technical projects, entrepreneurial ventures, and data driven business development.
