It’s likely that your company pays for tons of services that have automated dashboards to give feedback on how you’re doing. But, you probably have little control over the data points you get back, little understanding of how to get the most of the data by applying it to specific business question, and overwhelm at the sheer size and immediacy of the problem your team faces.\nHere, I’ll share some techniques to easily parse mountains of data with SQL.

Whether their response was positive or negative, they were between 40% to 51% more likely to respond positively to this telemarketing campaign.\nBased on the data, shifting calls from Monday to Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday could lead to 154 more positive responses to the telemarketing campaign while only adding 15 minutes of call time to each day. That’s a 19% increase for spreading 45 minutes of calls to the rest of the week.\nEvery demographic variable has a statistically significant correlation with responses to the campaign. By prioritizing different target audiences the campaign could see a net improvement in positive response rate.\nNow, let’s dig in!\nExploration of Dataset The Bank_Marketing_Dataset draws on real-world data gathered from a Portuguese retail bank that was conducting a telemarketing campaign for selling long-term bank deposits between May 2008 to June 2013.
