## Key Differentiators from Other Analysts
**Communication** - Experience in tech sales, entrepreneurship, and freelance work. This has honed the ability to speak to non-technical audiences with a relatable and charismatic style.

**Technical** - Experience in software development in a professional environment. Resulting in knowledge of version control, documentation, and a suite of tools not typically used by an analyst.
